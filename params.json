{"name":"Team 5 Final Project","tagline":"the IST 412 team five final project - to connect the BES particle simulator to an external controller ","body":"\r\n\r\n### How to connect to this project:\r\n### 1) Download .zip, put it anywhere\r\nthe project .zip is called team5midiLights-master.zip.    \r\n unzip and you get the folder team5midiLights-master    \r\n\r\n### 2) Open project team5midiLights-master in NetBeans\r\n### 3)under Team at the top, select \"Team >> Git >> initialize repository\"\r\njust click \"ok\" to put this in the same folder as the project (it the default)\r\n### 4) under Team at the top, select \"Team >> Commit..\"\r\nput your name in the Commit Message: window, then hit the \"commit\" button\r\n### 5) under Team at the top, select  \"Team >> Remote >> Pull.. \r\n(NOT pull from upstream) the first choice selected is the local git    \r\n we want the second one \"Specify Git Repository Location\".     \r\n\r\nset the \"Repository URL:\" to https://github.com/hancharik/team5midiLights.git    \r\n\r\nhit next, under Remote Branches select master - origin>master   \r\n\r\nafter the pull you will be asked to rebase or merge. for this first time, just rebase    \r\n\r\n### 6) Make a change to the code\r\nchange one of the teamMemberButtons on StartPanel.java line 370ish to your name.   \r\n\r\n(in teamMemberButtonx = new JButton(\"vacant\") change \"vacant\" to your name)    \r\n\r\nunder Team at the top, select \"Team >> Commit..\"   \r\n  \r\nunder the commit message put \"changed a name button\", and commit.  \r\n\r\n### 7)under Team at the top, select  \"Team >> Remote >> Push..   \r\n\r\n(NOT push to upstream) the first choice selected is the local git    \r\n  \r\n we want the second one \"Specify Git Repository Location\".    \r\n\r\nset the \"Repository URL:\" to https://github.com/hancharik/team5midiLights.git, >>next>>   \r\n\r\nSelect Local Branches:  select master -> master [U]  >>next>>  \r\nUpdate Local References:  select master -> origin/master [U]  >>finish>>  \r\nThat's it, you are good to go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![bes particle simulator](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/bessq.png)\r\n### Team Five Final Project\r\nWe will be connecting the BES particle simulator to an external controller, midi and motion if time allows\r\n![microsoft kinect](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/team5stages.png)\r\n### Establishing a connection\r\nMIDI is an obvious choice, as there are enough variables to allow for some interesting changes to the particles in real time.  Connecting to a camera controller such as Microsoft Kinect [Book on open source programming for the Kinect](http://www.amazon.com/Kinect-Open-Source-Programming-Secrets/dp/0071783172/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1445871834&sr=8-5&keywords=Microsoft+Kinect+3d+Motion+Controller) or using the camera on an Android phone would allow the user to control the light show with their hands (We only need to be able to access control for the mouse listener and a click event). Shining the screen at maximum brightness in a dark room could make for some interesting effects, although the dark room might require use of the accelerometer.\r\n\r\n![a shitty little single-axis mind controlled helicopter](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/mcrms.png)\r\n### Why MIDI? \r\ncontrolling the particle variables in real time with midi will be the main goal. It will be a good environment for running tests  (4 midi channels and 5-10 variables) \r\nMIDI isn't about music, it's about multi-variable controllers. If we can connect to these particles, we can connect to any variable in any program, or even an airframe or robotic arm.\r\n\r\n [5 axis control for about $400](https://emotiv.com/store/epoc-detail/)\r\n\r\n###\r\n![team 5 soak](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/team5soak1.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
