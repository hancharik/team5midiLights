Connecting to a camera controller such as Microsoft Kinect [Book on open source programming for the Kinect](http://www.amazon.com/Kinect-Open-Source-Programming-Secrets/dp/0071783172/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1445871834&sr=8-5&keywords=Microsoft+Kinect+3d+Motion+Controller) or using the camera on an Android phone would allow the user to control the light show with their hands (We only need to be able to access control for the mouse listener and a click event). Shining the screen at maximum brightness in a dark room could make for some interesting effects, although the dark room might require use of the accelerometer.\r\n\r\n![a shitty little single-axis mind controlled helicopter](http://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/images/mind-controlled-helicopter.jpg)\r\n### A Mind Controlled Light Show\r\n all we need is x and y axis control, and we can move the light show with our mind. The hardware to do this is really getting to within a reasonable price point (the little single-axis EEG controlled helicopter in the pic is cool, but not 200/axis cool). We would be insane not to try to do something like this, way too much fun. [I just found this, I didn't know they are getting this good - 5 axis control for about $400](https://emotiv.com/store/epoc-detail/)\r\n\r\n###\r\n![team 5 soak](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/team5soak1.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
