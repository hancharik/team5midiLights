Connecting to a camera controller such as Microsoft Kinect [Book on open source programming for the Kinect](http://www.amazon.com/Kinect-Open-Source-Programming-Secrets/dp/0071783172/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1445871834&sr=8-5&keywords=Microsoft+Kinect+3d+Motion+Controller) or using the camera on an Android phone would allow the user to control the light show with their hands (We only need to be able to access control for the mouse listener and a click event). Shining the screen at maximum brightness in a dark room could make for some interesting effects, although the dark room might require use of the accelerometer.\r\n\r\n![a shitty little single-axis mind controlled helicopter](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/mcrms.png)\r\n### Why MIDI? \r\ncontrolling the particle variables in real time with midi will be the main goal. It will be a good environment for running tests  (4 midi channels and 5-10 variables) \r\nMIDI isn't about music, it's about multi-variable controllers. If we can connect to these particles, we can connect to any variable in any program, or even an airframe or robotic arm.\r\n\r\n [5 axis control for about $400](https://emotiv.com/store/epoc-detail/)\r\n\r\n###\r\n![team 5 soak](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/team5soak1.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
